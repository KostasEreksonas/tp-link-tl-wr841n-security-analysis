# TP Link TL-WR841N router cybersecurity analysis

# Prerequisite

After testing the security of my IP camera I've decided to do an overview of the security of my router.

# Plan of analysis

1. Find open ports.
2. Find firmware and installed software.
3. Check for known exploits.
4. Check the severity of found exploits.
5. Present the ways of how to mitigate the risks.
6. Conclusion.
